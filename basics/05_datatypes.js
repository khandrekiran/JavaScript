/* The old JS and the current JS have few differences. The previous JS
didnt had classes, modules, data functions etc but the newer ones now have.
The code written in the past and the code written currently had differences.

Hence we write "use strict;" => means treat all JS code as newer version */


//alert ("hello");
//alert (3+3); // now we are using nodejs and not browser
